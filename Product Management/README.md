VA OIT is committed to delivering user-friendly, secure, modern digital products to users. To this end, VA is	proactively training our team on product management tools and methods, highlighting the differences between project and product management:

Project management focuses on managing to a plan:
- Manage cost, schedule, risk, resources, communications, etc.
- Report status and ensure compliance
- Lots of documents and meetings
- Success = You delivered according to your plan!

Product management focuses on delivering something a user wants or needs
- Understand user needs by conducting user research
- Deliver minimum viable products (MVPs) using agile, design thinking, and devops methods
- Success: You delivered a product that users love and use!
